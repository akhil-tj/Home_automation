Hello Everyone.


 This is my first project on github.The project is based on Home Automatiom using simple & cheap IOT devices.In this project an overview of current and emerging home automation systems is discussed.

 Nowadays most home automation systems consist of a smartphone and microcontroller. A smart phone application is used to control and monitor the home appliances using different type of communication techniques. In this project the working principle of different type of wireless communication techniques such as Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and Chatbot are studied and their features are compared with each other so the users can choose their own choice of technology to build home automation system.

 Moreover in this work the advantages and drawbacks of different home automation systems is discussed and highlighted.

Over View of the project is given below in deatail :
Components required, System design, Implementation & Testing is explained thoughtout.
